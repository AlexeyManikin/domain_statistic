# Use the following settings to change JVM parameters
#
# Change the initial and maximum memory for the JVM
#
# Notes:
# - 1.5GB of memory is needed for the current size of the combined RPKI repositories
# - You may want to raise this value if you see 'out of memory' errors in the log
# - A higher maximum will allow the JVM to use more system memory and spend less time on
#   garbage collection (slight speed improvements possible)
jvm.memory.initial=1024m       # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
jvm.memory.maximum=2048m      # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm

# Proxy settings are used by the JVM when fetching data for the BGP Preview and
# notifications about new RPKI Validator releases. 
#
# Notes:
# - rsync is used as an external program and will not use this proxy
# - you should only specify one type of proxy, if you specify both 'socks' is preferred
